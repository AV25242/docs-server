Answer the prompts for the username and password for the Couchbase Server web console:

 ** Username is `Administrator`
 ** Password is your instance ID

. When you have successfully logged in, you should be presented with the Couchbase Server Administration Web Console [.ui]*Cluster Overview* window.
The server is automatically configured for you.

After the instance has started, it will operate just like any Couchbase Server instance.
This single instance can operate independently, or can be added to a group of similar instances to create a cluster.
